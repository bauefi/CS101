### Exercise 3 ###
Write a program which will raise any number x to a positive power n
using a "for loop". (Is there any way to improve the efficiency of
your program?)

The program should read in the number the user wants to use and the power
to which it should be raised. Like so:

  This program raises a number x to a non-negative integer power n
  Please enter a number:
  10
  To what power would you like to raise it?
  2
  The number 10 raised to the power 2 is 100
