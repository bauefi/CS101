### Exercise 2 ###
Alter the program for question 1 so that it prompts the user for the lowest
and highest Fahrenheit temperature wanted in the table,
and also prompts the user for the desired step size between rows of the table
(the step size is 20 in question 1). The program should begin by explaining
to the user what it does, and should appropriately echo the user's input
before printing the table.
