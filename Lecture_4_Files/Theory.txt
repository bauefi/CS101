### 4.1. Why use files? ###
All the programs we have looked at so far use input only from the keyboard,
and output only to the screen. If we were restricted to use only the keyboard
and screen as input and output devices, it would be difficult to handle large
amounts of input data, and output data would always be lost as soon as we turned
the computer off. To avoid these problems, we can store data in some secondary
storage device, usually discs. Data can be created by one program, stored on
these devices, and then accessed or modified by other programs when necessary.
To achieve this, the data is packaged up on the storage devices as
data structures called files.

### 4.1. Reading from a file ###
This is a fairly simple topic in Python, try and google how it works as you solve
the exercises.
