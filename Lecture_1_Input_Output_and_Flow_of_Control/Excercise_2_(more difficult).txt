(More difficult.) Alter your program from question 1 so that it deals with months as well as years,
and produces output such as the following:

		Enter the current year then press RETURN.

		1996

		Enter the current month (a number from 1 to 12).

		10

		Enter your current age in years.

		36

		Enter the month in which you were born (a number from 1 to 12).

		5

		Enter the year for which you wish to know your age.

		2001

		Enter the month in this year.

		6

		Your age in 6/2001: 41 years and 1 month.

The program should cope with singulars and plurals properly in the output, e.g. "1 month" but "2 months".

Hints: you will have to introduce extra variables,
and may find the following arithmetical operations useful:

Symbol   Operation       Example     Value

+        Addition        3 + 5       8

-        Subtraction     43 - 25     18

*        Multiplication  4 * 7       28

/        Division        9 / 2       4

%        Modulus         20 % 6      2

(Notice that when the division sign "/" is used with two integers, it returns an integer.)
You may also want to use the following comparison operators:

Symbol   Meaning                    Example    Value

<        less than                  3 < 5      TRUE

<=       less than or equal to      43 <= 25   FALSE

>        greater than               4 > 7      FALSE

>=       greater than or equal to   9 >= 2     TRUE

==       equal to                   20 == 6    FALSE

!=       not equal to               20 != 6    TRUE
