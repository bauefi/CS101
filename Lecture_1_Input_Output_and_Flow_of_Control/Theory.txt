### Example File ###
The file AgeCalculator.py contains an example python program
that demonstrates how one can read information from the keyboard and then print
information to the computer screen. The last couple of lines also demonstrate how
an if statement works. You can see how a coder can build logical structures in his
programs.

### Running the program ###
Try to use the terminal to run all of your code
Simply navigate into the folder of the file you want to run
using the "cd" command and execute [name_of_program].py on the command to
run the file.

### In and output ###
"\n" --> Print this to cause a line break on the screen

### If statments ###
The last few lines of our example program are:

if another_age >= 0:
    print("Your age in " + str(another_year) + ": " + str(another_age))
else:
    print("You weren't even born in " + str(another_year) + "!");

This is an example of if ... else ... branching, a familiar construct in many
procedural programming languages. In python the general syntax is

if condition:
  Statement1
  ...
  ...
  ...
  Statement2;
else:
  StatementN+1
  ...
  ...
  ...
  StatementN+M

The image "if_statement" shows how an if statement works. The computer eveluates
the conditions you have give one after another and as soon as one of them is true
proceeds to execute the statements you have written in the body of the condition.
It only every executes one branch. In my mind the if statement is precisely where
the capabilities of Excel stop.

It is quite common to see if statements strung together in programs, as follows:

if total_test_score < 50:
  print("You are a failure")
elif total_test_score < 65:
  print("You have just scraped through the test")
elif total_test_score < 80:
  print("You have done quite well")
elif total_test_score < 95:
  print("Your score is excellent. Well done")
else:
  print("You cheated")
